User Interactions
Moving the Basket:

Simulate movement with a concept:
"Imagine" using arrow keys to slide the basket left and right.
No up/down movement is needed for the MVP.
Object Behavior:

Eggs and candies fall straight down.
Basket "catches" an object if visually aligned with it.
Conditions/Logic (Simulated in the MVP)
1. Object Caught
If the egg or candy visually lands inside the basket:
Egg: Add points to the score.
Candy: Add bonus points to the score.
2. Object Missed
If an object reaches the bottom of the screen without landing in the basket:
Reduce the lives count by 1.
Add a visual cue like a broken egg on the ground (for missed eggs).
3. Wrong Object Caught
If a "danger" object is caught (optional for MVP):
Subtract lives or add a penalty.
4. Game Over
Triggered when:
Lives = 0.
Display a simple "Game Over" message with a button: "Try Again."
